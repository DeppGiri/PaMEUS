# PaMEUS
The objective of this project is to implement a model to capture methane generated in paddy fields and further utilize it for several purposes thus reducing methane levels. The proposed project aims at real-time monitoring methane emissions in a paddy field and informs the user wirelessly if the emissions are exceeding the concentration set by the user.
